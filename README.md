# IntelliGuard
Detects threat using machine learning algorithm
Designed and Developed Intelli Guard, I implemented cutting-edge ML models, blending 
supervised and neural network-based unsupervised learning to mine diverse data sources.
This data-driven approach yielded a 20% improvement in threat classification,
bolstering our security posture and thwarting potential breaches. Overall it was measured to have 98%
probability of risk.
